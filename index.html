        <h1>Breaking News: Four Injured in Serious Car Crash in Toronto</h1>
        <h2>Toronto, July 6, 2024</h2>
        <p>A serious car crash occurred in downtown Toronto late last night, leaving four individuals injured.</p>
        <p>Authorities report that the accident took place at approximately 11:45 PM at the intersection of King Street and Spadina Avenue. The collision involved two vehicles, both heavily damaged upon impact.</p>
        <p><strong>The victims have been identified as Aman Popal, 65, and Farzana Siddiqui, 46, along with two teenagers, aged 15 and 17, whose names are being withheld due to their ages.</strong> All four were occupants of a single vehicle.</p>
        <p>Emergency responders were quick to arrive at the scene, where they provided immediate medical assistance. Aman Popal and Farzana Siddiqui were transported to Toronto General Hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. The two teenagers were taken to SickKids Hospital and are reported to be in stable condition.</p>
        <p>Witnesses described the crash as severe, with both vehicles sustaining significant damage. "It was like nothing I've ever seen," said one witness. "There was debris everywhere, and the sound was deafening."</p>
        <p>The Toronto Police Service's Traffic Services unit is currently investigating the cause of the accident. Preliminary reports suggest that one of the vehicles may have run a red light, leading to the collision. Authorities are urging anyone with additional information or who may have witnessed the accident to come forward.</p>
        <p><strong>This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of road safety and adherence to traffic laws.</strong></p>
